          Founded in 2010 by two friends who shared a love for Mediterranean
          cuisine, Little Lemon has grown from a small bistro to a bustling
          eatery known for its delicious dishes and warm atmosphere. Our menu
          features a variety of traditional and modern recipes, all prepared
          with care and served with a smile.
